# To-Do List

My big overview list of what needs to be done.

## Setup [1hr]

* <del>Tweak htaccess </del>
* <del>Config.php</del>
* <del>Database.php</del>
* <del>Build menu helpers</del>


## Locale [2.5hr]

* <del>View</del>
* <del>Add</del>
* <del>Edit</del>
* <del>Delete</del>
   * <del>Show count of terms defined in the locale.</del>

### Follow-up

* Get bar graph in there, showing what percentage translation is at.
* [i] possible when user clicks locale, they got to /terms with that locale set, and sorted so they can see what needs to be updated?

## Terms

* <del>Index view</del>
   * This was a challange; see [my post](http://tim.hithlonde.com/2013/victory-over-a-big-wall/) on getting the query working correctly
   * <del>js for changing chosen locale view</del>
   * js for aditing list of terms for chosen locale
* Add
   * Be sure to have dropdown of what locale the initial definition is in
* Edit term
* Edit localized terms
* Delete

## Pages

* View index
* Add page
* Edit page
* Edit pageterms

## Ideas

* Build demo Json return /page_num/[localeid]/
