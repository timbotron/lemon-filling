{"name":"Lemon-filling","tagline":"A tool to build localization (multi-language) support into your small to medium-sized application.","body":"## Overview\r\n\r\nLemon-filling is a tool to build localization (multi-language) support into your small to medium-sized application. With Lemon-filling, you can create terms, define those terms in various locales, and group terms together into pages. Via MySQL query in your application, ask for a page, specify the locale you desire, and all terms on that page will be returned. Comes with web-based admin area to create and manage your localized content.\r\n\r\nLemon-filling is suitable for web-based and traditional applications. It is open-source and free to use.\r\n\r\n## Breakdown\r\n\r\nLemon-filling works by breaking up the complex idea of localizing your application into three simple categories.\r\n\r\n### Locale\r\n\r\nLocale is the language or languages your application will support. If it supports English and Deutch, then those are the locales. Also, the **localeid** would probably be 1 and 2, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\nTerms are any clump of text in your application. It could be a label in a form, or a paragraph in your help section. Terms are referenced by their **term_tag**.\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr><th>term_tag</th><th>term</th></tr>\r\n  <tr><td>about_text</td><td>\"Our application was designed with all citrus fruit lovers in mind and...\"</td></tr> \r\n  <tr><td>l_name</td><td>\"Username:\"</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td>l_pass</td><td>\"Password:\"</td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n### Pages \r\n\r\nA page is any total 'page' for your application. For example if you have an 'Add Post' page in your app, you would create a page in the admin tool called 'add_post', and then attach any terms that would belong in that page.\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\nA demo of the admin area of Lemon-filling can be [found here](http://lab.citracode.com/lemon-filling/).\r\n\r\nTo see the localized data output:\r\n* [Dynamic JSON](http://lab.citracode.com/lemon-filling/pages/json/sign_in/1) of the 'sign_in' page with terms in English.\r\n* [Dynamic JSON](http://lab.citracode.com/lemon-filling/pages/json/sign_in/2) of the 'sign_in' page with terms in German.\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n* Tim Habersack\r\n* tim@hithlonde.com\r\n* http://tim.hithlonde.com\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright 2013 Tim Habersack.
